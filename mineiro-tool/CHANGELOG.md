# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `server.ts` split into `server/routes/{email,registry}.ts`; `server.ts` now only holds the banner, middlewares, router mounting, `/api/health` and `startServer()`. Rate limits keep applying to the same routes.
- The server version now comes from `package.json` (`server/version.ts`) for health and the startup log; `version:check` no longer inspects `server.ts`.
- **Behavior change:** `HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1` (was `0.0.0.0`), so `npm run dev` is no longer exposed on the LAN. The Dockerfile sets `ENV HOST=0.0.0.0`.
- Web UI: heavy views and modals (Dashboard, Correlation, Batch, Export, History, Shortcuts, Scan settings) load on demand; the initial JavaScript bundle drops from 365 kB to 222 kB gzip.
- Official Colab notebook (v1.7.0): partial checkout of `mineiro-tool/`, `npm ci`, production build and `node dist/server.cjs` instead of the Vite dev server.
- A failed lazy chunk no longer blanks the app: views and modals are wrapped in `LazyBoundary` (inline notice + reload), modals mount only when opened, and the initial page loads just the main bundle and CSS.
- Browser errors no longer leave an empty dark page: a root error boundary shows the error on screen and the page reports errors to `POST /api/client-log`, which prints them in the server log (the Colab Diagnostics cell shows it).
- The server logs `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` instead of exiting. The Colab notebook frees a busy port and checks the page and an asset through the VM network interface before showing the link.

### Removed
- **All AI integrations:** Gemini Analyst Copilot (`/api/intelligence/copilot*`, `/api/osint/gemini-validate`, `src/ai/`), the AI workspace/panel/key modal, `AI_SYNTHESIZED` provenance, `AiProfileReport` and every `aiProfile` prop, the `@google/genai` dependency, `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the AI toggles in scan/batch settings.
- Legacy `/api/osint/profile` endpoint and its heuristic modules (`platformSignalExtractor`, `behavioralEngine`, `threatActorHeuristics`), plus the unused `fetchAiProfile` / `isAiLoading` state in `App.tsx`.
- Unused files: `AiProfileCard.tsx`, `DossierTimeline.tsx`, `ExportModal.tsx`, `geminiProfiler.ts`, `reportGenerator.ts`, `platformTimelineData.ts`; unused devDependency `autoprefixer`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-10-02

### Security
- `/api/osint/verify` only accepts URLs that a registry detector can produce; DNS is resolved through a guarded lookup (private, loopback, link-local and metadata ranges blocked, DNS-rebinding safe) and every redirect hop is re-validated.
- Token-bucket rate limiting, security headers, 2 MB body limit, `MINEIRO_PUBLIC` mode for shared instances.
- `package-lock.json` committed; CI uses `npm ci`.

### Detection quality
- Differential baseline: each detector is also probed with a random non-existent handle; targets whose page is indistinguishable from it are classified absent (removes most soft-404 false positives).
- Declarative detectors (`registry/detectors/*.json`) with matchers, provenance, verification date and canary handles; weekly `detector-health` workflow opens an issue on drift.
- Results carry `evidenceHash` (SHA-256), `collectedAt`, `detectorVersion`; per-host concurrency cap and 5-minute result cache.

### Data model and interoperability
- SQLite store (`node:sqlite`): Entity → Observation → Claim; a claim must cite existing observations.
- STIX 2.1 export (`/api/store/export/stix`).

### OSINT
- Username variants with Jaro-Winkler similarity, pivot extraction with depth/budget planning, avatar dHash, Wayback CDX summary, CNPJ lookup via BrasilAPI (company-level fields only).
- Copilot: provider-enforced JSON schema and post-validation that drops evidence ids not present in the assessment.

### Distribution and project hygiene
- `pip install mineiro-osint`: self-contained wheel (~1.3 MB) with a `mineiro` command; uses system Node >= 22.5 or the Node shipped by `nodejs-wheel-binaries`; binds to 127.0.0.1; CI installs the wheel in a clean venv and boots it.
- English `README.md` (default) with an animated demo; Portuguese kept in `README.pt-BR.md`.
- Release workflow: pushing a `v*` tag builds the app, the wheel and a GitHub Release with these notes.
- Server honors `HOST` (default `0.0.0.0` for containers).

### Engineering
- Evidence engine extracted to `src/core`; Vitest suite with HTML fixtures.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-28

### Persistent Case Graph
- Added long-lived Cases stored locally in IndexedDB.
- Primary scans append immutable collection snapshots to the matching Case.
- Graph pivot investigations persist inside the active Case.
- Reopening a Case restores its latest primary collection and persisted pivots.
- Existing five-scan localStorage cache remains available for quick compatibility restores.
- Resetting the workspace detaches the active Case without deleting it.

### Diff Intelligence
- Added snapshot-to-snapshot comparison for the same target.
- Change classes: NEW, DISAPPEARED, CHANGED, UNCHANGED, CONFIDENCE_UP and CONFIDENCE_DOWN.
- Metadata, URL, status and confidence movements are tracked separately.
- Inconclusive transitions remain explicitly caveated.
- DISAPPEARED is treated as a collection difference, not proof of account deletion.
- Added Case Diff smoke tests to CI.

### Deployment
- Hardened Docker runtime with reproducible npm ci installs.
- Runtime image uses production dependencies only and runs as the non-root node user.
- Added container healthcheck against /api/health.
- Added deployment guidance for Colab, Docker, managed containers and VPS.
- Case persistence remains browser-local, so the backend stays stateless in v1.6.


## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-27

### Graph Hunting
- Similar-user candidate nodes can launch background pivot scans directly from the relationship graph.
- Pivot scans preserve the current investigation instead of replacing it.
- Pivot findings are merged into the active graph as observed profile edges.
- Candidate similarity edges remain explicitly candidate even after a successful pivot.
- Added Mineiro Graph Query, a local read-only graph query engine.
- Added query presets for similar usernames, shared domains, observed profiles, strong edges, same-domain relations and target-to-profile paths.
- Query results visually highlight matched nodes/edges and dim unrelated graph elements.
- Added optional local Neo4j/Cypher export without requiring a Neo4j dependency or remote connection.
- Added graph hunting smoke tests to the product quality gate and CI.
- Added dedicated Graph Hunting documentation.

### Safety and analytical semantics
- Similar username remains a discovery hypothesis, not identity proof.
- Pivot success confirms public presence of the candidate handle on observed services only.
- Candidate and observed edges retain separate semantics in UI and exports.


## [1.4.4] - 2026-09-27

- Complete 22-section intelligence report.
- Known / Assessed / Unknown executive framing.
- Source Quality grades A-E and requirement-aware Intelligence Priority Score.
- Expanded correlation graph: username/email, profile, platform, domain, public URL, display name, organization, public project and optional avatar-hash entities.

- Snapshot language now correctly describes integrity verification rather than authorship or legal chain of custody.
- AI Analyst Copilot follows the selected Intelligence Requirement.
- Post-scan navigation remains centered on the Intelligence Report.

### Validation

- Server telemetry and health version updated to v1.3.

### Notes
